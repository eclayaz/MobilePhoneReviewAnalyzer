I cannot even slide to unlock the phone because the screen won't work. Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The iPhone 5C uses a 1,136 x 640 pixel screen. The resulting 326ppi pixel density is the same pixel pitch that saw the introduction of the term ‘Retina’ display – meaning so sharp you can’t see the pixels.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The iPhone 5C uses a 1,136 x 640 pixel screen. The resulting 326ppi pixel density is the same pixel pitch that saw the introduction of the term ‘Retina’ display – meaning so sharp you can’t see the pixels.</mobile_phone:comment>

However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The iPhone 5C uses a 1,136 x 640 pixel screen. The resulting 326ppi pixel density is the same pixel pitch that saw the introduction of the term ‘Retina’ display – meaning so sharp you can’t see the pixels.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The iPhone 5C uses a 1,136 x 640 pixel screen. The resulting 326ppi pixel density is the same pixel pitch that saw the introduction of the term ‘Retina’ display – meaning so sharp you can’t see the pixels.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone. Big bummer</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>I bought this for my daughters birthday gift. I am having to send it back the day after her birthday. The screen backlight is jacked up. The touch screen does not work. I cannot even slide to unlock the phone because the screen won't work. Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

I cannot even slide to unlock the phone because the screen won't work. Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>the iPhone 5c (and iPhone 5s) feature a 4in Retina display as opposed to the 3.5in display of the older models. Being 176 pixels taller means the display offers a 16:9 aspect ratio – which is the same as an HDTV.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone. Big bummer</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models.

    <mobile_phone:comment>The iPhone 5C uses a 1,136 x 640 pixel screen. The resulting 326ppi pixel density is the same pixel pitch that saw the introduction of the term ‘Retina’ display – meaning so sharp you can’t see the pixels.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>the iPhone 5c (and iPhone 5s) feature a 4in Retina display as opposed to the 3.5in display of the older models. Being 176 pixels taller means the display offers a 16:9 aspect ratio – which is the same as an HDTV.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>the iPhone 5c (and iPhone 5s) feature a 4in Retina display as opposed to the 3.5in display of the older models. Being 176 pixels taller means the display offers a 16:9 aspect ratio – which is the same as an HDTV.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the \"No SIM card\" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone. Big bummer</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>the iPhone 5c (and iPhone 5s) feature a 4in Retina display as opposed to the 3.5in display of the older models. Being 176 pixels taller means the display offers a 16:9 aspect ratio – which is the same as an HDTV.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

    <mobile_phone:comment>I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the \"No SIM card\" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The iPhone 5C uses a 1,136 x 640 pixel screen. The resulting 326ppi pixel density is the same pixel pitch that saw the introduction of the term ‘Retina’ display – meaning so sharp you can’t see the pixels.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>the iPhone 5c (and iPhone 5s) feature a 4in Retina display as opposed to the 3.5in display of the older models. Being 176 pixels taller means the display offers a 16:9 aspect ratio – which is the same as an HDTV.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

I cannot even slide to unlock the phone because the screen won't work. Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>4in display is designed so that you can hold the iPhone in your hand and reach all parts of the screen comfortably. You can't do this with a bigger display unless you have bigger hands, so if one-handed use is important to you then the iPhone 5c's display will be the perfect size for most.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>If your current camera is an iPhone 4S or older you will notice a marked difference. The iPhone 5c (or iPhone 5) camera offers faster photo capture, better low-light performance and improved noise reduction compared to those previous models. HDR captures are also faster when compared to older iPhones.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The phone works great. It has minor scratches as it was used, but works fine. The battery life is short lived and needs charging daily, but overall it's good.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>I found that the iPhone 5C is far better suited to shooting photos when held in portrait, with icons easier to reach and the volume keys which double as shutter buttons perfectly placed for my fingers.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The bigger issue here though is with your stray fingers getting in the way of the camera lens. If the camera had been centralised this wouldn't be an issue</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>if you fancy turning brightness up to full whack and then fire up some power-intensive games you'll see that battery drain pretty quickly, but the iPhone 5C still performs better here than the 5.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>I ran a 90 minute HD video at full brightness on the iPhone 5C, with various accounts syncing in the background and it saw a drop of 26% in battery life.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>the iPhone 5c (and iPhone 5s) feature a 4in Retina display as opposed to the 3.5in display of the older models. Being 176 pixels taller means the display offers a 16:9 aspect ratio – which is the same as an HDTV.</mobile_phone:comment>

    <mobile_phone:comment>I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the \"No SIM card\" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone.</mobile_phone:comment>
